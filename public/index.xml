      <description>Spoiler alert: We did it using Hugo, a framework for building websites.
Our goals were  Minimmal to zero HTML,CSS and JS coding. Simple deployment. No dedicated CI tools. Integrated with git using Github or Bitbucket. No server or ssl management. Static site generator for simplicity, security &amp;amp; speed. Easy to update and roll back.  Hosting requirements  As easy and cheap as possible. Safe &amp;amp; reliable.  Using this list we put out the question to our developer friends and Hugo was somewhere in the mix.</description>
