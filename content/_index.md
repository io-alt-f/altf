# Welcome to ALT-F

We are a professional team of developers and dev ops running the Pool [`ALT-F`](https://adapools.org/pool/5ededda4f4d60589d113a234fae1cb11774868c2f0c583486b38c11f) on `Cardano`  

ALT-F is the lowest cost pool as we take ZERO percentage margin so all the rewards are for you the delegator.  

    A word of caution if you intend to follow our blogs about setting up a Stake pool. 
    We use a containerized approach using Docker and it adds a level of complexity that will
    frustrate if you are unfamiliar with Docker and containerization in general.
