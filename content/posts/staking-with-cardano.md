## Summary

- Cardano users could earn 4.5% per year by staking ADA
- You can run your own stake pool like we are doing or join an existing pool
- Cardano's staking model is designed to avoid centralization and your ADA never leaves your control

Cardano has launched its Shelley upgrade, which introduces staking rewards for users who hold the ADA cryptocurrencies. Here’s what you can expect from Cardano’s staking features.

The most important take away is that when you stake your ADA never leaves your wallet! You have separate keys for spending and for staking. You can instantly spend your staked ADA or switch pools.

Rewards are paid out on each **"epoch"** which is every five days. It's important to understand that you do not get any rewards for the first epoch. More on that later. 

## How to join a Pool?

Firstly you need to find a pool to join.

We would love you to join ours *ALT-F* but websites like PoolTool, Adapools and the Cardano Daedalus wallet all provide filtering on pools.
In both the Daedalus and Yori wallets you choose to stake from within the wallet. It's super easy. Watch here

Once you’ve staked your ADA, you don’t have to do anything. All rewards are automatically paid out and are automatically re-invested to give you the benefit of compounding. You can withdraw your rewards and your stake at any time.

## Is Cardano the best choice for me?

Cardano is the safest in our opinion and the most decentralized of the Staking options available. Having your staked ADA in your wallet means it never leaves your control. Cardano has also been compared to a stable coin which it's defiantly not but it's volatility is lower than other alt coins.

Cardano is often criticized for taking years to deliver its promised staking feature when other blockchains like Tezos, TRON, and Cosmos took much quicker. But you must also remember that Cardano always uses academic pier reviews of its planned functionality. This slows them down but as a developer of a financial platform myself I can say the more detailed planning and reviews pre development the better the final outcome.

Cardanos rewards are not the highest but they are the safest. The decision is yours.
