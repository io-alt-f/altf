## What is staking

ADA held on the Cardano network represents a stake in the network, with the size of the stake proportional to the amount of ADA held. The ability to delegate or pledge a stake is fundamental to how Cardano works.

There are two ways an ADA holder can earn rewards.
1.  By delegating their stake to a stake pool run by someone else ALT-F. 
2.  Setting up and running their own stake pool.
   
The amount of stake delegated to a given stake pool is the primary way the Ouroboros protocol chooses who should add the next block to the blockchain, and receive a monetary reward for doing so.

The more stake is delegated to a stake pool (up to a certain point), the more likely it is to make the next block â€“ and the rewards are shared between everyone who delegated their stake to that stake pool.

## What is stake delegation

Delegation is the process by which ADA holders delegate the stake associated with their ADA to a stake pool. It allows ADA holders that do not have the skills, capital or desire to run a node to participate in the network and be rewarded in proportion to the amount of stake delegated.

## How to actually stake

1. Buy ADA on an exchange like Coinbase.
2. Send the stake to your Yori or Daedalus ADA Wallet.
3. Choose to delegate your stake.

It is really that easy.  
For the first two epoch you will not receive any reward but you make that up later when you withdraw and receive for the following two epochs.
