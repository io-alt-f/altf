## Hi

We are a professional team of developers and Dev Ops who have worked together for many years.

Although we are only five we cover the continents of North America, Europe, Africa and Australasia. Looking for people from Antarctica, Asia or South America to complete the team :smile:

After working with Cardano in our company we loved it so much that we wanted to become of the community and contributing.  
Setting up and running a pool reliably is no simple task but Stake Pools are an essential part of making Cardano decentralized and we wanted to be part of that.

If you like what you see then follow us on Telegram @alt-f and consider delegating to our pool [`ALT-F`](https://adapools.org/pool/5ededda4f4d60589d113a234fae1cb11774868c2f0c583486b38c11f)
